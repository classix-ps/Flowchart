# Flowchart

This repo is dedicated to a graph creation tool made with SFML. It enables the user to create personalized dependency graphs. The user has full control over nodes (in their respective names and positions) and arrows (connecting 2 nodes at a time).

Library dependencies are:
- https://www.sfml-dev.org/
- https://github.com/classix-ps/sfml-widgets/tree/custom (fork of sfml-widgets library, custom implementation on branch 'custom')

The following graph depicts the structure of the project in this repo (created by graphviz):
